Typically a text string, along with the payload&rsquo;s length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same payload back to the sender. The idea appears to be that this can be used as a keep-alive feature, with the echo functionality presumably meant to allow verifying that both ends continue to correctly handle encryption and decryption.</p></div><div><p>The affected versions of OpenSSL allocate a memory buffer for the message to be returned based on the length field in the requesting message, without regard to the actual size of that message&rsquo;s payload. Because of this failure to do proper bounds checking, the message returned consists of the payload, possibly followed by whatever else happened to be in the allocated memory buffer.</p></div><div><p>Heartbleed is therefore exploited by sending a malformed heartbeat request with a small payload and large length field to the vulnerable party (usually a server) in order to elicit the victim&rsquo;s response, permitting attackers to read up to 64 kilobytes of the victim&rsquo;s memory that was likely to have been used previously by OpenSSL. Where a Heartbeat Request might ask a party to &ldquo;send back the four-letter word &lsquo;bird&rsquo;&rdquo;, resulting in a response of &ldquo;bird&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Heartbleed Request&rdquo; (a malicious heartbeat request) of &ldquo;send back the 500-letter word &lsquo;bird&rsquo;&rdquo; would cause the victim to return &ldquo;bird&rdquo; followed by whatever 496 subsequent characters the victim happened to have in active memory.</p></div><div><p><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/heartbleed/heartbleedexample.svg" alt="Heartbleed"></p></div></div></div><div id="Digital-certificates"><div><h1> <span style="color:#da1953">Dig</span>ital certificates </h1></div><div id="Introduction-Digital-Cert."><div><h2>Introduction</h2></div><div><p>In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third party, trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.</p></div><div><p>In cryptography, a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate&rsquo;s contents (called the issuer). If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate&rsquo;s subject. In Transport Layer Security (TLS) a certificate&rsquo;s subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS is notable for being a part of HTTPS, a protocol for securely browsing the web.</p></div><div><p>In a typical public-key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the certificate issuer is a certificate authority (CA), usually a company that charges customers to issue certificates for them. By contrast, in a web of trust scheme, individuals sign each other&rsquo;s keys directly, in a format that performs a similar function to a public key certificate.</p></div><div><p><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/digitalcertificate/certificatehierarchy1.JPG" alt="Digital certificate hierarchy"></p></div></div></div><div id="DHCP-Protocol"><div><h1> <span style="color:#da1953">DHC</span>P Protocol</h1></div><div id="Introduction-DHCP"><div><h2>Introduction</h2></div><div><p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet.</p></div><div><p>DHCP can be implemented on networks ranging in size from home networks to large campus networks and regional Internet service provider networks. A router or a residential gateway can be enabled to act as a DHCP server.</p></div></div><div id="Overview"><div><h2>Overview</h2></div><div><p>DHCP operates based on the client–server model. When a computer or other device connects to a network, the DHCP client software sends a DHCP broadcast query requesting the necessary information. Any DHCP server on the network may service the request. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as default gateway, domain name, the name servers, and time servers. On receiving a DHCP request, the DHCP server may respond with specific information for each client, as previously configured by an  administrator, or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network and for the time period for which the allocation (lease) is valid. A DHCP client typically queries for this information immediately after booting, and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information. When a DHCP client refreshes an assignment, it initially requests the same parameter values, but the DHCP server may assign a new address based on the assignment policies set by administrators.</p></div><div><p>Depending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP addresses:</p></div><div><ul><li>Dynamic allocation: A network administrator reserves a range of IP addresses for DHCP, and each DHCP client on the LAN is configured to request an IP address from the DHCP server during network initialization. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period, allowing the DHCP server to reclaim and then reallocate IP addresses that are not renewed.</li><li>Automatic allocation: The DHCP server permanently assigns an IP address to a requesting client from the range defined by the administrator. This is like dynamic allocation, but the DHCP server keeps a table of past IP address assignments, so that it can preferentially assign to a client the same IP address that the client previously had.</li><li>Manual Allocation: Also commonly called static allocation and reservations. The DHCP server issues a private IP address dependent upon each client&rsquo;s client id (or, traditionally, the client MAC address), based on a predefined mapping by the administrator. If no match for the client&rsquo;s client ID (if provided) or MAC address (if no client id is provided) is found, the server may or may not optionally fall back to either Dynamic or Automatic allocation.</li></ul></div><div><p>DHCP is used for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6.</p></div></div><div id="Operations"><div><h2>Operations</h2></div><div><p>Step 1</p></div><div><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/dhcp/step1.jpg" alt="Step 1"></p></div><div><p>When client boots up it broadcast a DHCPDISCOVER message looking for a DHCP server note dstIP address.</p></div><div><p>Step 2</p></div><div><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/dhcp/step2.jpg" alt="Step 2"></p></div><div><p>DHCPOFFER is a broadcast UDP packet and it replies with network configuration such as IP, lease time, DNS, subnet mask and default gateway, of course you can renew the lease when expired.</p></div><div><p>Step 3</p></div><div><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/dhcp/step3.jpg" alt="Step 3"></p></div><div><p>DHCPREQUEST says that the client accepts the configurations sent by the Server.</p></div><div><p>Step 4</p></div><div><img src="/cyber/blog/cybersecurityinterviewquestions/dhcp/step4.jpg" alt="Step 4"></p></div><div><p>It is an acknowledgement packet to confirm that the server will registers client’s information.</p></div><div><p>ROUTING PROTOCOLS (to add)</p></div><div><p>OSPF (to add)</p></div></div></div><div id="ARP-Protocol"><div><h1> <span style="color:#da1953">ARP</span> Protocol</h1></div><div id="Introduction-ARP"><div><h2>Introduction</h2></div><div><p>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address.</p></div><div><p>Whenever a device needs to communicate with another device in a Local Area Network (LAN) it needs the MAC address for that device and devices use ARP protocol to acquire the MAC address for that device.</p></div><div><p>An IP address is used to locate a device on a network and the MAC address is what identify the actual device.</p></div></div><div id="Operating-Scope"><div><h2>Operating Scope</h2></div><div><p>The Address Resolution Protocol is a request-response protocol whose messages are encapsulated by a link layer protocol.

If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified.

Kerberoasting is used by attackers once they are established inside an enterprise network and have begun reconnaissance for lateral movement.

An origin consists of a URI scheme, domain and port number. This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page&rsquo;s Document Object Model.  For example, consider the following URL:</p></div><div><p><code>http://normal-website.com/example/example.html</code></p></div><div><p>This uses the scheme http, the domain normal-website.com, and the port number 80. The following table shows how the same-origin policy will be applied if content at the above URL tries to access other origins:</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th>URL accessed</th><th>Access permitted?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>http: //normal-website.com/example/</td><td>Yes: same scheme, domain, and port</td></tr><tr><td>http: //normal-website.com/example2/</td><td>Yes: same scheme, domain, and port</td></tr><tr><td>https: //normal-website.com/example/</td><td>No: different scheme and port</td></tr><tr><td>http: //en.normal-website.com/example/</td><td>No: different domain</td></tr><tr><td>http: //www.normal-website.com/example/</td><td>No: different domain</td></tr><tr><td>http: //normal-website.com:8080/example/</td><td>No: different port*</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p>When a browser sends an HTTP request from one origin to another, any cookies, including authentication session cookies, relevant to the other domain are also sent as part of the request. This means that the response will be generated within the user&rsquo;s session, and include any relevant data that is specific to the user. Without the same-origin policy, if you visited a malicious website, it would be able to read your emails from GMail, private messages from Facebook, etc.</p></div></div><div id="Question-and-Answer"><div><h1> <span style="color:#da1953">Que</span>stion and Answer</h1></div><div id="Difference-between-XSS-and-CSRF"><div><h2>Difference between XSS and CSRF</h2></div><div><p>Cross-site scripting (or XSS) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the browser of a victim user. Cross-site request forgery (or CSRF) allows an attacker to induce a victim user to perform actions that they do not intend to.</p></div><div><p>The consequences of XSS vulnerabilities are generally more serious than for CSRF vulnerabilities:</p></div><div><p><ul><li>CSRF often only applies to a subset of actions that a user is able to perform.  Conversely, a successful XSS exploit can normally induce a user to perform any action that the user is able to perform, regardless of the functionality in which the vulnerability arises.</li><li>CSRF can be described as a &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; vulnerability, in that while an attacker can induce the victim to issue an HTTP request, they cannot retrieve the response from that request. Conversely, XSS is &ldquo;two-way&rdquo;, in that the attacker&rsquo;s injected script can issue arbitrary requests, read the responses, and exfiltrate data to an external domain of the attacker&rsquo;s choosing.</li></ul></p></div></div><div id="Describe-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-(CSRF)"><div><h2>Describe Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2></div><div><p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.</p></div><div><p>It’s sometimes possible to store the CSRF attack on the vulnerable site itself. Such vulnerabilities are called “stored CSRF flaws”. This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack.</p></div></div><div id="Can-CSRF-tokens-prevent-XSS-attacks?"><div><h2>Can CSRF tokens prevent XSS attacks?</h3></div><div><p>Some XSS attacks can indeed be prevented through effective use of CSRF tokens. Consider a simple reflected XSS vulnerability that can be trivially exploited like this: <code>https://insecure-website.com/status?message=&lt;script&gt;/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></div><div><p>Now, suppose that the vulnerable function includes a CSRF token:</p></div><div><p><code>https://insecure-website.com/status?csrf-token=CIwNZNlR4XbisJF39I8yWnWX9wX4WFoz&amp;message=&lt;script&gt;/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></div><div><p>Assuming that the server properly validates the CSRF token, and rejects requests without a valid token, then the token does prevent exploitation of the XSS vulnerability. The clue here is in the name: &ldquo;cross-site scripting&rdquo;, at least in its reflected form, involves a cross-site request. By preventing an attacker from forging a cross-site request, the application prevents trivial exploitation of the XSS vulnerability.</p></div></div><div id="What-are-the-phases-of-a-penetration-test?"><div><h2>What are the phases of a penetration test?</h2></div><div><p><ul><li>Information Gathering</li><li>Reconnaissance</li><li>Discovery and Scanning</li><li>Vulnerability Assessment</li><li>Exploitation</li><li>Post Exploitation</li></ul></p></div></div><div id="What-is-the-difference-between-a-risk-assessment,-vulnerability-assessment,-and-penetration-test?"><div><h2>What is the difference between a risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, and penetration test?</h2></div><div><p>Risk Assessment is composed by 5 steps:</p></div><div><p><ul><li><strong>Context establishment</strong>: Identify and describe the context of the Risk Assessment process, considering external and internal context.
